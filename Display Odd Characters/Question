In the main method, write code to read a String value using Scanner and print characters at odd position as single String (Not index but position. Refer below example).

E.g If the input value is "Matrix". Then we have total 6 characters with 'M'at first position and 'x' at 6th position.
Hence the characters at odd position will be 1st, 3rd and 5th character which is "Mti".
If the input value has space or any other special character then the same should be conuted as usual.
E.g if the input value is "Hi There" then the output will be "H hr"

Note that the output is printed in same line with all characters together. ("Mti" and "H hr").

public class Solution
{

public static void main(String[] args)
{
//code to read values
//code to display the result
}
